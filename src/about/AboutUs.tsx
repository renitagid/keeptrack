        A transformative initiative to remove litter, create jobs and beautify
        California
      </h2>
      <p>
        Trash has plagued Californiaâ€™s streets and highways for decades. Clean
        California makes significant investments in litter collection, community
        engagement and education to ultimately transform unsightly roadsides
        into spaces of pride for all Californians. This is truly a statewide
        effort with potential projects in all 58 counties and with nearly a
        third of the funds going directly to cities, counties, tribes and
        transit agencies to clean local streets and public spaces.
